{"text": "Being right here in NYC, we know how you feel. Many viewers would like to see the Yankee games. Unfortunately, the YES channel is not currently on the Campus Cable lineup due to licensing costs, which are similar to premium channel costs. Considering the fact that most students leave campus in May, and the games airing in September are on national local or cable channels, the increase in cost does not balance out for two and half months of programming. As always, we wish to ensure a great channel lineup (over 80 channels!) at no cost to students. As a result, we are unable to add the YES Network to our system at this time. However, we continue to monitor the rates for the this channel should there be a change and will keep you informed of any progress.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living/residence-halls/campus-cable/cable-channel-guide.html"},

More and more university activities are conducted using computers and electronic communications, with increased convenience and accessibility from and to all parts of the world. At the same time, today\u2019s inter-connected environment intensifies the risks and threats of unauthorized access to computers, inadvertent disclosures of\u00a0sensitive data, and unexpected destruction of essential information, resulting in potentially serious consequences to individuals and to institutions.\u00a0Members of the University community\u00a0and\u00a0affiliates\u00a0interact with a wide spectrum of\u00a0sensitive data\u00a0for numerous reasons.

To do so, they used a piece of modified DNA as a drug to block the formation of PKMzeta. If another molecule or molecules act as a back-up mechanism for PKMzeta, the scientists reasoned, the new drug would block the formation of memory in normal mice, but would have no effect on memory in the knockout mice that cannot make PKMzeta \u2014 the drug would have nothing to work on.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2016/05/17/long-term-memory-has-back-up-plan-researchers-find.html"},

To do this, the plant replayed the steps of embryogenesis, first creating specialized tissues that, once assembled, generated a new set of stem cells. This showed that the important ingredient for long-term growth was not necessarily a stem cell imbued with cell-production properties, but, instead, the surrounding tissues that together created stem cell behavior.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2016/05/19/biologists-find-how-plants-reconstitute-stem-cells.html"},

{"text": "The research relies on an innovative mouse-tracking technique that uses an individual\u2019s hand movements to reveal unconscious cognitive processes\u2014and, specifically, the stereotypes they hold. Unlike surveys, in which individuals can consciously alter their responses, this technique requires subjects to make split-second decisions about others, thereby uncovering a less conscious preference through their hand-motion trajectory. Using this mouse-tracking software Freeman developed, the millimeters of movement of a test subject\u2019s mouse cursor can be linked with brain-imaging data to discover otherwise hidden impacts on specific brain processes.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2016/05/02/neuroscientists-find-evidence-for-visual-stereotyping.html"},
{"text": "In the first of two studies, Freeman and Stolier monitored subjects\u2019 brain activity\u2014using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)\u2014while these subjects viewed different faces: male and female as well as those of various races and depicting a range of emotions. Outside the brain scanner, the subjects were asked to quickly categorize the gender, race, and emotion of the faces using the mouse-tracking technique. Despite their conscious responses, the subjects\u2019 hand movements revealed the presence of several stereotypical biases. Notably, men, and particularly Black men, were initially perceived \u201cangry,\u201d even when their faces were not objectively angry; and women were initially perceived \u201chappy,\u201d even when their faces were not objectively happy. In addition, Asian faces were initially perceived \u201cfemale\u201d and Black faces were initially perceived \u201cmale,\u201d regardless of the faces\u2019 actual gender. The researchers confirmed, using a separate group of subjects, that the specific pattern of visual biases observed matched prevalent stereotypical associations in the U.S. to a significant degree.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2016/05/02/neuroscientists-find-evidence-for-visual-stereotyping.html"},
{"text": "The researchers\u2019 fMRI findings backed these assessments, demonstrating that such stereotypical biases may be entrenched in the brain\u2019s visual system, specifically in the fusiform cortex, a region involved in the visual processing of faces. For instance, the neural-activation patterns elicited by Black male faces in this region were more similar to those elicited by objectively angry faces, even when such faces did not display any actual angry features (e.g., due to stereotypes of Black individuals as hostile). Moreover, the extent of this stereotypical similarity in neural-activation patterns was correlated with the extent of bias observed in a subject\u2019s hand movements. For example, the extent to which a subject\u2019s hand initially veered toward the \u201cangry\u201d response when categorizing a non-angry Black male face predicted the extent to which neural-activation patterns for Black male faces and angry faces were more strongly correlated in the subject\u2019s fusiform cortex.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2016/05/02/neuroscientists-find-evidence-for-visual-stereotyping.html"},

As another example, the neural-activation patterns elicited by White female faces were more similar to those elicited by objectively happy faces, even when such faces did not display any actual happy features (e.g., due to stereotypes of women as appeasing). In addition, neural-activation patterns elicited by Asian faces were more similar to those elicited by female faces, regardless of the actual gender (due to stereotypes associating Asians with more feminine traits).", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2016/05/02/neuroscientists-find-evidence-for-visual-stereotyping.html"},
{"text": "In the second study, the researchers replicated the overall findings in a larger group of subjects and ruled out alternative explanations, such as whether inherent physical resemblance or visual similarities in certain faces may explain the results. They also measured each subject\u2019s own stereotypical associations using an additional task and demonstrated that it was a subject\u2019s own unique associations that specifically predicted the visual biases and neural-activation patterns observed. These findings cemented the evidence that one\u2019s own learned stereotypes can change the way that an individual sees another person\u2019s face and also demonstrated that this form of visual stereotyping is not limited to particular associations. Rather, whatever associations an individual has learned over his or her lifetime are likely to be expressed in the form of this visual stereotyping, the findings suggest.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2016/05/02/neuroscientists-find-evidence-for-visual-stereotyping.html"},

In the case of hydrogen, the most versatile and highly selective is the so-called inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopy.

{"text": "This gives rise to the INS spectrum, a collection of peaks that in principle contains a wealth of information about the quantum dynamics of hydrogen and the guest-host interactions. However, extracting this valuable information from the spectra is not easy. The key concept in spectroscopy in general is that of selection rules, which determine whether transitions between certain pairs of states of a system are forbidden, and therefore should be absent from the spectra, or allowed. Knowing the selection rules is crucial for the correct interpretation of the spectra; incorrect assumptions about them will inevitably lead to wrong conclusions.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/01/07/scientists-find-unsuspected-spectroscopy-rules-for-rattling-hydrogen.html"},

Then in 2013, the group of Ba\u010di\u0107 derived theoretically a selection rule for the INS spectroscopy of H2 inside the almost spherical cage of the \u201cbuckyball\u2019\u2019 molecule  C60 (H2@C60), the first ever to be predicted in the INS of any kind of molecular system. H2@C60 has fascinated researchers as a felicitous union of the simplest of all molecules, H2, with one of the most elegant, highly symmetric, and intellectually captivating molecules, C60. According to the newly derived selection rule, certain well-defined transitions in the INS spectra of H2@C60  are forbidden and as such should not be present in the spectra, contradicting the common wisdom that all INS transitions are allowed.  Establishing for the very first time the existence of an INS selection rule made it essential to provide its experimental confirmation.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/01/07/scientists-find-unsuspected-spectroscopy-rules-for-rattling-hydrogen.html"},

The INS spectra of H2@C60 were recorded under high resolution in Grenoble, on one of the best neutron scattering spectrometers in existence. These high-quality spectra revealed that all INS transitions accessible experimentally, which our selection rule predicts to be forbidden, are indeed systematically absent from the measured spectra. This provided definitive and complete experimental validation of the theoretically predicted selection rule.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/01/07/scientists-find-unsuspected-spectroscopy-rules-for-rattling-hydrogen.html"},

From Ancient to Modern: Archaeology and Aesthetics includes some 50 outstanding ancient Mesopotamian objects and more than 100 illuminating documents, photographs, and drawings, with a focus on excavations from the 1920s and 30s, when many important finds were unearthed at sites in present-day Iraq.

As seen in a number of photographs that illuminate life at the site, Woolley was a dashing figure, sometimes sporting a fedora, a tight jacket, and even dress shoes amid the dust and dirt of an active dig. His team of international archaeologists included one woman, the widow Katharine Keeling, whom he would marry.

The tomb contained a remarkably rich concentration of jewelry, found on and with the queen\u2019s body. Much of this was discovered as masses of gold and semi-precious beads, pendants, and other individual components with which the expedition team worked to re-create the original jewelry. The exhibition includes Puabi\u2019s richly beaded cloak and belt, re-created from extraordinary numbers of carnelian, lapis lazuli, and gold beads, and a dazzling headdress comprising lavish gold components that include a massive floral-shaped comb, fillets of pounded sheets of gold, and botanical wreaths.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/01/26/isaw-exhibition-from-ancient-to-modern-opens-feb-12.html"},

In its original reconstruction, represented in the exhibition through photographs, the piece has striking similarities with headbands worn during the 1920s and 30s, including a contemporaneous example designed by Cartier, though Woolley indicates in his note cards that he was reconstructing it as he felt the archaeological evidence indicated. In fact, although the Woolleys\u2019 version of the headdress was aesthetically pleasing, more recent research by the Penn Museum indicates that it was not in fact a single ornament but most likely a series of beaded strands with pendants.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/01/26/isaw-exhibition-from-ancient-to-modern-opens-feb-12.html"},

Between 1930 and 1937, four expeditions on behalf of the Oriental Institute led by Henri Frankfort, a Dutch-born, London-educated archaeologist and historian of classical art, uncovered hundreds of Sumerian statues located in architectural contexts, many identified as temples. Dating from the mid-third millennium BCE, the statues included standing male and female figures with hands clasped in front, perhaps in worship, and seated cup-bearing males, all considered the paradigms of their types.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/01/26/isaw-exhibition-from-ancient-to-modern-opens-feb-12.html"},

{"text": "Viewed together, the archival material sheds light on the ways in which these artifacts were approached from an aesthetic perspective and placed within an art historical context. For example, Frankfort (who would become director of the Warburg Institute, in London) was among the first archaeologists to use the word \u201csculpture\u201d to describe ancient statuary, and his descriptions frequently used the vocabulary of art historical formalism. In articles, letters, and books, he stated that the creators of the figures had \u201cfollowed abstraction to its utmost limits,\u201d and repeatedly described the statues with such terms as \u201cform,\u201d \u201cmass,\u201d and \u201cspace\u201d\u2014all associated with the description of early- and mid-twentieth-century art. In the introduction to his well-known book More Sculpture from the Diyala Region, for example, he stated that the statuary was marked by \u201ca vigorous and inventive stylization with obvious traces of experiment.\u201d The focus on form was also used to link these Sumerian objects to so-called \u201cprimitive\u201d art, from which many contemporary artists had drawn inspiration, and to describe them as \u201cuniversal,\u201c a term often used in association with fine art and one that helped to position the statues as the origin point of Western art.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/01/26/isaw-exhibition-from-ancient-to-modern-opens-feb-12.html"},

{"text": "Deutsches Haus at NYU will present a concert with Ramsch und Rosen, two Austrian musicians (Julia Lacherstorfer and Simon Z\u00f6chbauer) who rummage for old tunes among old paintings, manuscripts, and between the lines of old letters, finding a treasure trove of material underneath the layers of dust. The event is Tuesday, January 20, at 6:30 p.m.\n \n Their music bridges past and present - a past where the clocks tick differently and a present where we can connect to the entire world and choose from an immeasurable number of opinions, and pick the most precious, most suitable items for our individual character. The result: A type of unique music that is inseparable from the people who perform it. It needs to take place within them, earnestly, yet with a wink.\n \n \u201cThe most beautiful moment in a concert is when everything starts to coalesce: we with our music, our music with the audience, the audience with space and time, so that only the present moment exists with its sound and image.\"\n \n The playground they are moving on contains traditional tunes and songs from Austria as well as improvisations and their own written tunes. Simon Z\u00f6chbauer was born in 1988 in Herzogenburg, Lower Austria. He performs vocals, and plays the trumpet, zither, electr. tanpura, and shruti box. Simon studies at the Vienna University of Music and Performing Arts (among others) and work as a musician and composer in Austria and abroad.\n \n Julia Lacherstorfer was born in 1985 in Bad Hall, Upper Austria. Julia performs vocals, and plays the violin, ankle bells, and shruti box. Julia studies at the Anton Bruckner Private University in Linz (among others) and works as a freelance musician and composer in Austria and abroad.\n \n Events at Deutsches Haus \u2013 42 Washington Mews, New York, N.Y. \u2013 are free of charge. If you would like to attend this event, please send us an email to deutscheshaus.rsvp@nyu.edu.

{"text": "Recent years have seen a change in drug use patterns, especially for older adults, with an increase in their admission to substance abuse treatment and increased injection drug use among those over the age of 50. Yet, there has been little research regarding the epidemiology, health status, and functional impairments in the aging population of adults accessing opioid treatment. \n\t\n\tOf the few studies on this population to date, most have been based off of a limited dataset that only accounts for treatment admissions, and therefore may not fully capture the utilization of substance abuse treatment over time. Furthermore the treatment episode dataset (TEDS), defines an older adult as aged over 50 or 55, and may not fully demonstrate how the population is aging.\n\t\n\tGiven the gaps in existing data, researchers affiliated with New York University's Center for Drug Use and HIV Research (CDUHR), and NYU\u2019s School of Medicine (NYUSoM) sought to elucidate age trends for opioid treatment programs, with an emphasis on older adults, in a new study published in the Journal of Substance Use  Misuse.

Furthermore, China\u2019s history is one of verse, as its poetic traditions give readers both insight into its civilizational story through the voices of its poets -- from soldiers and emperors to proud women and men, from everyday folk and exceptional historical figures to artists and scholars of the highest rank. In short, to come to a real understanding of China--and, especially the aesthetic pleasures of Chinese culture--one must spend time among its poets. This is as true of China in our global age as it is of China\u2019s deep history: English-language translations of China\u2019s poetry are attempts--profoundly beautiful in their own right--to translate something essential about Chinese identity while also striking universal chords.", "current_url": "http://shanghai.nyu.edu/study-away/summer-courses"},

{"text": "This four credit course examines the role and functions of journalists and the media in Chinese society as modern reporting moves into the digital media landscape. To provide context to the political and cultural environment of news-gathering, the course assesses the development of journalism in China through the 20th century from around the birth of the Republic of China (1911) and through to the modern era. It will examine the relatively free publishing environment for newspapers in the lead-up to establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China (1949) and the imposition of government control thereafter. Through providing an understanding of the parallel publishing environment of institutional traditional media ownership and today\u2019s free-enterprise online media corporations, the unit studies how reporters operate in both. Students will gain an understanding of the strong nexus between government and media and the ever-present need for journalists to portray various aspects of Chinese ideology at the same time as functioning as news reporters. The portrayal of media as propagandist will be considered against the abiding devotion of journalists to lift the veils on truth. The roles, functions and rounds of journalism as practiced in China will be studied through class discussion and assignments and these will include reporting across all publishing platforms of politics, business, the environment and national issues. The impact of digital journalism will be an underlying theme through the course. The course structure will involve lectures, workshops, seminars, guest speakers and an industry visit. There will be two 3-hour classes per week.

{"text": "This brief presents the underlying theory of change surrounding the strategies implemented in seven single sex schools serving Black and Latino boys (grades 4-12). Our attention to the theories surrounding these strategies rests on the presumption that school practice involves complex processes and theories that are often overlooked, especially in current educational reform efforts (e.g., whole school reform, \"turnaround\" schools strategies). Our analytical approach to understanding single-sex schools for boys of color is to ask the question: what do you do and why do you do it.Our analysis of interviews and focus groups with 75 practitioners (e.g., administrators, teachers, guidance counselors, and social workers) uncovered two overarching theories regarding Black and Latino boys that guide the design of these schools:\u00a0Theory 1\u00a0- schools need to understand and have a knowledgebase of the social/emotional needs of Black and Latino boys and\u00a0Theory 2\u00a0- schools need to understand how the academic needs of Black and Latino boys have surfaced and target strategies for addressing those needs.\u00a0 As this brief demonstrates, it is such an analytical perspective that begins to outline the theory of single-sex schools as an educational equity intervention for Black and Latino boys.", "current_url": "https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/metrocenter/center/research_evaluation/resources"},

For each of the survey\u2019s five subscales, mean ratings were calculated for candidates at the beginning and end of their program, as well as the differences in these ratings. T-tests were calculated to compare pre/post data, identifying the extent of meaningful change.

{"text": "For the last forty years researchers have posited competing theories regarding the relative influence of social class background and racial-group membership on the school experiences, academic performance, behavior, and motivation of ethnic minority students. The general purpose of these competing theories has been to explain why ethnic minority students fail or succeed in schools. This study represents an initial foray into a complex conversation on internal and external social identification, racial constructs and interaction as part of the schooling experience of Latino students. Two significant findings from the larger study are reported in this article. First, the negotiation of identity among these Mexican and Puerto Rican students in predominantly African American schools demonstrates racial/ethnic boundary designations (i.e., who is in and who is out) as structured by skin color. Secondly, what is meant to be designated as White-looking, Hispanic/Mexican-looking, or Black/Bi-Racial looking maintained differing meaning and latitude in the racial/ethnic boundary options across skin color groups. Both these findings posit further questioning as to what we know about identification among Latino students, and more importantly how it gets played out in schools.", "current_url": "https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/metrocenter/center/research_evaluation/resources"},

In the morning, we would purchase the \u201cRacing Form,\u201d which contains extensive data about each horse running in the races for that particular day. During lunch breaks and recess at school, my friend and I would scrutinize the data carefully and develop heurisitcs for choosing horses based on past performance and current odds.

{"text": "The European Court of Justice (CJEU) traditionally has been viewed as an institution in the vanguard of the development of anti-discrimination law, particularly with regard to gender equality, which has been part of EU law since 1957. In 2000, the EU enacted a new set of anti-discrimination laws with respect to age, race, disability, sexual orientation, and religion. In ongoing research, Gr\u00e1inne de B\u00farca, Florence Ellinwood Allen Professor of Law, is examining the cases invoking this legislation before the CJEU, questioning why there has been relatively little litigation and whether the court has become increasingly cautious in its anti-discrimination rulings.", "current_url": "http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/ideas/Grainne-de-Burca-EU-anti-discrimination"},
{"text": "\u201cI was curious to find out what had happened in relation to these laws, which had initially been controversial and took some time to be adopted,\u201d de B\u00farca says. \u201cAs lawyers examining the impact of a new law, we often ask, has there been litigation? Because litigation can indicate either resistance to the law or use being made of the law.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0", "current_url": "http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/ideas/Grainne-de-Burca-EU-anti-discrimination"},
{"text": "De B\u00farca has found significant disparities in the amounts of litigation depending on the type of discrimination. While more than 20 age discrimination cases have come before the CJEU since 2000, there have been just seven cases concerning disability discrimination, five on sexual orientation discrimination, three on racial discrimination, and none alleging religious discrimination.", "current_url": "http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/ideas/Grainne-de-Burca-EU-anti-discrimination"},
{"text": "The uneven volume of litigation may be related to what de B\u00farca describes as the \u201chierarchy of equalities\u201d within EU anti-discrimination law. While the original gender equality rule (an equal pay rule) in EU law was \u201cdirectly effective,\u201d meaning it became law in all EU member states without needing transposition into domestic law, the newer anti-discrimination laws had to be enacted by each of the 29 EU member states. Many states delayed implementing the laws or enacted them only partially.", "current_url": "http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/ideas/Grainne-de-Burca-EU-anti-discrimination"},
{"text": "There also may be gaps or weaknesses in the laws themselves. In the area of race discrimination, the new laws prohibit discrimination on grounds of racial or ethnic origin, but allow discrimination on the ground that the person is not an EU member state national. In the Servet Kamberaj case, an Albanian national who applied for housing benefits in Italy was rejected due to his status as a third-country national. The CJEU ruled that he had not been discriminated against on the basis of his ethnic origin but rather his immigration status.", "current_url": "http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/ideas/Grainne-de-Burca-EU-anti-discrimination"},

{"text": "The court has also been weaker in dealing with intersectional cases concerning multiple grounds of discrimination. In one case, a woman born without a uterus who had a child by surrogacy was denied the right to maternity leave. The CJEU ruled that there had been no gender or sex discrimination; no violation of EU laws concerning mandatory maternity leave because she had not physically given birth; and no disability discrimination because she was able to perform her job. \u201cThe Court\u2019s answer was a no on all fronts,\u201d de B\u00farca says. \u201cAnd so this woman, whose circumstances fall at the intersection of each of these \u2018protected grounds\u2019 of EU law was afforded no legal protection.\u201d", "current_url": "http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/ideas/Grainne-de-Burca-EU-anti-discrimination"},
{"text": "Going forward, de B\u00farca plans to look at anti-discrimination cases moving through the national courts of member states and to investigate whether there are cases that are deliberately not being referred to the CJEU. She is initially studying the UK, France, Belgium, Greece, Cyprus, Austria, and Germany. \u201cGermany, for example, has been strongly resisting a new proposed European anti-discrimination law because the state is skeptical about the prospect of interfering with the freedom of employers and businesses through further anti-discrimination legislation at EU level,\u201d says de B\u00farca. \u00a0", "current_url": "http://www.law.nyu.edu/news/ideas/Grainne-de-Burca-EU-anti-discrimination"},

The startup charges users a small monthly fee to watch local pro\u00adgramming on their computers or mobile devices\u2014the same local programming that could be watched for free on a TV with rabbit ears, Aereo argued.

{"text": "This course is designed to teach students how to conduct effective advocacy before administrative agencies and courts on a wide range of issues, from environmental protection to public safety. While the substantive areas of administrative law and regulatory policy vary greatly, the course teaches a core set of skills -- including statutory interpretation, policy analysis, and understanding the political context of regulation -- that is required in all administrative law practices. The ability to critique the economic analyses that underlie agency actions is also an increasingly valuable tool for advocacy in the modern regulatory state. Through hands-on participation in regulatory proceedings and a weekly seminar that focuses on the institutional structures and substantive standards of administrative decision-making, students will have the opportunity to cultivate these skills.", "current_url": "http://www.law.nyu.edu/academics/clinics/semester/regulatorypolicy"},

Targeted agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor, and the Department of the Interior. In addition to policy analysis and administrative law skills, fieldwork provides rich opportunities for students to gain skills in collaborative problem-solving, effective communication of legal issues and strategies, working with non-legal experts, and relationship building.", "current_url": "http://www.law.nyu.edu/academics/clinics/semester/regulatorypolicy"},

Through readings, class discussions, case studies, workshops, and peer critiques, the seminar will focus on developing theoretical and practical understanding of the regulatory process, bureaucratic decision-making, and executive and judicial review of agency action. The seminar also reviews the agency practice of cost-benefit analysis and will help students build the tools to critique the economic analyses that underlie rules. Using both academic literature and fieldwork as jumping-off points, the seminar will focus on developing a rounded approach to administrative lawyering that includes consideration of the legal, policy, economic, and political issues that shape administrative decisions.", "current_url": "http://www.law.nyu.edu/academics/clinics/semester/regulatorypolicy"},

I don\u2019t think McCain-Feingold weakened the state parties. The truth is that the world had changed to the disadvantage of state parties for decades. Party money flowed from the states up to the federal government. By the time I began practicing in the 1970s that wasn\u2019t true anymore, and critics would say that state parties and election cycles were pumped up with national activists who were sent to the states to run the state parties and with national resources that were sent to state parties. McCain-Feingold didn\u2019t create that set of circumstances. It may have accelerated the difficulties of all of the parties. It certainly created some difficulties for the national parties by shutting off a main source of financial support, but it\u2019s very difficult to say in my view that McCain-Feingold was responsible for it. So, the plea I\u2019m issuing is for recognizing how often we fail with these institutional design issues. We become terribly excited at a particular moment by the panic of the day. Not too many years ago the view was that Republicans would never ever obtain control of the Congress unless they had term limits, and then they gave up term limits once they gained control of the Congress.", "current_url": "http://blogs.law.nyu.edu/magazine/2013/great-divide/"},

Increasingly there is a view that the large national issues that we are dealing with are essentially a zero-sum game. Therefore you\u2019re not splitting the difference when you compromise, you\u2019re giving up, you\u2019re losing. To defend that point of view there is an impulse to adopt a very stern moral tone so that the refusal to negotiate is not being unreasonable, it is being principled. That has to do with the way in which arguments are increasingly framed around issues that Tom Edsall calls \u201cthe age of scarcity.\u201d We don\u2019t have the resources to allocate fairly among all of the potential participants.

Unfortunately, even without offering CEUs, individuals in restricted states won't be able to access the materials. The State Authorization issue has grown out of a consumer protection focus. Merely providing distance education to students in these respective states in exchange for payment, even without CEUs being granted, could trigger a state to notify the University of non-compliant activity. Restricting enrollments is best practice to protect the University from liabilities and potential fines for non-compliance. It is essential that (for now) individuals residing in these states simply be restricted from enrolling. \u00a0", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/academics/academic-resources/program-approval-process/non-new-york-state-authorization-and-distance-education/distance-education.html"},

{"text": "Joseph Caruso, Senior Affiliate Chaplain \nghanasyamdas@yahoo.com\nJoe Caruso was born in April of 1978 in Red Bank, NJ. From a young age he was deeply attracted to classical music and began playing the piano at about the age of 10. He pursued classical music throughout high school and into college where he studied with Dr. Min Kim and earned a degree in Music Education. However, during his last two years, a shift in his interest took place which he considered to be a natural progression from the Arts to Religion. Classical Music always put him in touch with the sublime and the sublimity of life itself. This led to a lot of deeper questions about himself, life, and God. He enthusiastically started reading many spiritual and holy books. It became such a passion for him that he began exploring and visiting various monasteries. After graduating college he had planned to live in one such monastery (Krishna Bhakti asrama, located in the lower east side of Manhattan) for one month before beginning his career. But he never left. He has been happily living there in the association of ten other monks for nine years now. Some student friends of his at NYU started a spiritual club on campus and invited him to give some classes. Since then he has had many wonderful relationships with students and faculty at NYU, and the cooking classes and Bhagavad Gita study groups have continued through the years.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/life/student-life/student-diversity/spiritual-life/religious-and-spiritual-life-on-campus/religious-centers-and-chaplains.html"},

I discovered Ethical Culture when my husband, who was raised Jewish, and I decided to marry. The Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture became ours and our children's spiritual home. It was there that I learned that religion could be inclusive, finding common ground with people who put deed before creed and chose to attribute worth and dignity to everyone. I was allowed, indeed encouraged, to bring my whole self through the door and empowered to co-create ethical community and meaningful relationships. It was also there that I became an unlikely music impresario: For ten years I ran The Very Good Coffeehouse, booking musicians for concerts and producing a CD.

{"text": "I was raised in a Christian family in Atlanta, Georgia, where I attended public school and later the University of Georgia to major in Psychology. I met my wife, Olivia, in my first year of college and we got married the day after I graduated. Spirituality has always been an important part of my life; I can remember having deep conversations with friends about religion as early as middle school. Into adulthood I have continued to enjoy the spiritual dialogue in its many forms, in how it affects our day-to-day lives and our perspective on eternity, both individually and societally. I am currently pursuing a masters degree in Biblical Studies, and see it as a major goal in my life to share with others the hope that I have personally found in the Christian faith.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/life/student-life/student-diversity/spiritual-life/religious-and-spiritual-life-on-campus/religious-centers-and-chaplains.html"},

He loved the balance of fun and substance he found in The Navigators- a group committed to going deep into the Scriptures and deep into relationships. He traveled to Mongolia to serve and teach English with The Navigators the summer between his junior and senior years. After NYU, he worked in downtown Manhattan on the business side of a non-profit for two years before going to Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary for his Master of Divinity. He then joined the staff of The Navigators so that he could provide others the same kind of authentic community that was so transformative for him. He loves John 10:10 where Jesus says, \u201cI came that they may have life, and have it to the full.\u201d Measuring in at 6-foot-7-inches, he\u2019s often asked, \u201cDo you play basketball?\u201d To which he might respond, \u201cDo you play miniature golf?\u201d Peter and his wife Amanda live in Brooklyn with their three little boys.", "current_url": "http://www.nyu.edu/life/student-life/student-diversity/spiritual-life/religious-and-spiritual-life-on-campus/religious-centers-and-chaplains.html"},

After graduating from Calvin College in 2008, a position with Americorps brought him to New York City. He immediately loved NYC, and realized it to be a place in which he wanted to invest himself long-term. Joel attended Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, graduating with an MA in Theology in 2014. He especially enjoys reading in cozy coffee shops, exploring the city on his bike, and playing frisbee in the park.

Amid her identity crisis during college years, God could finally capture her through His Word, bringing her deep peace and assurance that her ultimate identity is in Christ. Though she was studying in Wesleyan University, the very place she had the first life-changing Bible study was NYU. It is her joy to now engage with NYU students and worship together as a spiritual family. Ruth considers every activity of life as worship, and especially her kitchen as another sanctuary. Besides cooking, she enjoys sports--basketball, volleyball, tennis, golf, swimming...you name it.

{"text": "Anooradha Iyer Siddiqi is a historian of architecture and urbanism, and Assistant Professor and Faculty Fellow at the Gallatin School of Individualized Study. Her research into histories of architecture and urbanism focuses on modern sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, transnational spatial practice, and humanitarian and human rights studies. She received her Ph.D. in the History of Art and Archaeology from the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University and she teaches courses in the history and theory of architecture and cities. She is writing a manuscript drawing from dissertation research into sites, practices, and discourses in East Africa and Western Europe from the eighteenth century to the present that formed a history of encounters between architectural modernism and modern humanitarianism. Provisionally titled Humanitarian by Design: Dadaab, Industrializing Aid, and a History of Architecture as Emergency Technique, and based on archival and field research in the United Nations, European and African humanitarian NGOs, and refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia, this history suggests that the intersection of these fields transformed the political potency and spatial practices of each, the former through entanglements with sovereignty and human rights, and the latter through aesthetic and cultural concerns. Siddiqi is also undertaking research in India, Sri Lanka, and England for a manuscript that examines constructions of an \u201cAsian\u201d architectural modernism and a politics of the archive, through the activity of figures and organs of building practice, pedagogy, and discourse in South Asia in the twentieth century, particularly that of the architect Minnette de Silva and institutions and projects with which she associated, such as the journal MARG. Siddiqi\u2019s work has been supported by the Social Science Research Council, the Graham Foundation, the Institute of Fine Arts and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University, and the Institute of Urban and Landscape Studies at the University of Basel.

Special Considerations for Electronic Works\nWhen conducting a Fair Use analysis for an electronic work, both the quality of publication and ease of distribution are usually important considerations.

For example, reproductions that are of inferior quality and used for a different or \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose have in some cases been permitted by courts as Fair Use (e.g. digital \u201cthumbnail\u201d copies of images that could not be enlarged without loss of resolution).
