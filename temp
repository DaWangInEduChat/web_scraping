Her research uses an interdisciplinary approach to examine psychological and behavioral processes, and educational outcomes of immigrant adolescents. Saskias's dissertation, Ethnic Identity, Acculturation, and Perceived Discrimination for Indigenous Mexican Youth: A cross-cultural comparative study of Yucatec Maya adolescents in the U.S. and Mexico, explored how ethnic identity, acculturation levels, perceived discrimination, and sense of school belonging compare across Yucatec Maya Indigenous Latina/o adolescents in the U.S., non-Yucatec Maya Latina/o adolescents in the U.S., and Yucatec Maya Indigenous adolescents still in Mexico. The study revealed that Indigenous adolescents have different psychological and cultural experiences when compared to non-Indigenous Latina/o adolescents. Saskias is the recipient of the Diversifying Academia Recruiting Excellence (DARE) Fellowship (2009-2011) from Stanford University and of a Dissertation Support Grant from Stanford University School of Education.

She went on to earn a Master of Arts at New York University\'s Gallatin School of Individualized Study, focusing on African American and Afro-Caribbean Literature and History, having completed a Master\'s thesis on African diasporic carnival cultures. She has just completed her PhD in American Studies  Ethnicity at the University of Southern California where she continued her work on African diasporic performance practices. The dissertation analyzed "cyphers"\u2014spontaneous and improvisational dance circles in b-boying (breakdancing) culture. Titled, "Dark Matter in B-Boying Cyphers: Race and Global Connection in Hip Hop," this work considers the cultural and performative dimensions of Hip Hop as a global phenomenon through the microcosm of cyphers and the invisible yet influential forces described by informants that hold them together. The concept of "dark matter" becomes a metaphor for this substantive, unseen force, as well as a metaphor for the often unseen dimensions of African diasporic influences on cyphering. Dr. Johnson has received research and writing support from the Irvine Foundation (2003-2008), the Scholar-in-Residence program at The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at CUNY Hunter College (2005), the University of Southern California Urban and Global Studies Summer Fellowship (2005), and the Ford Dissertation Fellowship (2008-2009).

 'text': u'Matthew Vernon, fellow at the Gallatin School for Individualized Study, is a scholar of medieval literature. His teaching and research emphasize discovering points of contact between the Middle Ages and later periods. His points of entry into this include the themes of migration, errantry, genealogy, race and vernacularity, in addition to historical inquiry. His research follows some problems with the idea of literary inheritance: the invisible accretion of ideas through time and how writers engage or resist the work of earlier generations. As part of this inquiry, he considers the question of how meaning is generated collaboratively, between authors and across centuries in literature, while he also endeavors to create spaces for collaborative work, in the classroom and among scholars. His current book project, entitled Strangers in a Familiar Land, is a historical and literary study of the relationship between medieval and modern African-American literatures.

She holds a  Master of Public Administration                       from Cornell University and an MSW and Ph.D from  the School of Social Welfare at University of California, Berkeley.  She  is interested in the relationship                       between human service agencies and their  organizational capacity to serve minority groups.  Her dissertation  explores the contextual and organizational                       factors associated with service utilization by  ethnic minority populations.  As an Assistant Professor-Faculty Fellow  for the McSilver Institute for Poverty                       and Policy Research at the Silver School of Social  Work, she hopes to build on this research by collecting data and  designing studies that explore 1) the                       strategies used by ethnic agencies to engage  minority clients, and 2) how ethnic agencies can provide positive  individual and community outcomes for the                       populations they serve.  She has research and  practice experiences with a number of different ethnic agencies  providing a wide range of human services for                       low-income populations including housing, mental  health, and child care.

She is interested in the engineering of novel organic materials for renewable energy and clean water technologies. Her thesis work focused on establishing structure-function relationships between the morphology of organic semiconductor thin films and their electronic performance as the active layers in thin-film transistors and solar cells. Under the advisement of Professor Michael Ward at NYU, she plans to extend her research by using hydrogen-bonded frameworks to guide the self-assembly of both organic and inorganic crystals. The ability to tune the molecular packing of functional materials will in turn afford control over their optical and electronic properties, with the ultimate goal of engineering inexpensive devices for solar energy harvesting and water purification. Stephanie received her B.S. in Chemical Engineering at MIT in 2007 and her PhD in Chemical Engineering and Material Science at Princeton University in 2012.

As an artist, theorist, curator and storyteller, her work emphasizes feminist epistemologies and draws from a diverse range of methodological approaches in critical theory, performance theory, cultural studies, visual studies, postcolonial studies and posthumanities. She is especially interested in the interrelationship between aesthetics and politics and in analyzing the role of cultural resistance under periods of political repression. A doctoral candidate in the History of Consciousness Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, she is finishing her dissertation, Repertoires of Literary Resistance, which explores how literary performances during the 80s decade in Chile provide a symbolic space for the articulation of diverse democratic imaginaries. Her educational trajectory has taken her from the Americas to Asia, where she was granted scholarships from the Chinese government to pursue studies in Mandarin at Beijing University. Lissette is an alumna of the Whitney Museum\u2019s Independent Study Program and an independent curator and critic specializing in contemporary art with an emphasis in performance and transmedia. She has curated numerous individual and collective exhibitions, including Chile\u2019s first Performance Biennial in 2006, Grotesques at Toronto\u2019s A Space Gallery in 2008, and most recently Writing Resistance in Crisis and Collaboration at the UCSC Library. In 2009 she co-founded the Museum and Curatorial Studies faculty research group, which is dedicated to exploring the poetics and politics of display practices. Her own artistic production has been featured in museums and performance venues around the world. Currently, she is in the process of editing a volume about the queer Chilean performance collective Las Yeguas del Apocalipsis and co-editing another volume on contemporary curatorial praxis. Lissette has been granted the Fulbright, Andrew Mellon, Jacob K. Javits, and NYU Transition and Postdoctoral Academic Diversity Fellowships for her interdisciplinary work.'}

Shatima is interested in the intersection of race, space, gender, and culture. Her dissertation, \u201cPerforming Race and Shaping Community in the Black Barbershop\u201d focuses on how black people interpret and perform their racial identity, the processes by which they create community based on these understandings, and the significance of place and space in shaping these sentiments. The bulk of Shatima\u2019s research employs ethnographic methods to uncover what black people think constitutes an \u201cauthentic\u201d racial identity, how they signal this to others in everyday interaction, and how racially exclusive places shape understandings and performances of race. At NYU, Shatima is writing a book manuscript based on her dissertation research.

 'text': u'Anooradha Iyer Siddiqi is a historian of architecture and urbanism, and Assistant Professor and Faculty Fellow at the Gallatin School of Individualized Study. Her research into histories of architecture and urbanism focuses on modern sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, transnational spatial practice, and humanitarian and human rights studies. She received her Ph.D. in the History of Art and Archaeology from the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University and she teaches courses in the history and theory of architecture and cities. She is writing a manuscript drawing from dissertation research into sites, practices, and discourses in East Africa and Western Europe from the eighteenth century to the present that formed a history of encounters between architectural modernism and modern humanitarianism. Provisionally titled Humanitarian by Design: Dadaab, Industrializing Aid, and a History of Architecture as Emergency Technique, and based on archival and field research in the United Nations, European and African humanitarian NGOs, and refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia, this history suggests that the intersection of these fields transformed the political potency and spatial practices of each, the former through entanglements with sovereignty and human rights, and the latter through aesthetic and cultural concerns. Siddiqi is also undertaking research in India, Sri Lanka, and England for a manuscript that examines constructions of an \u201cAsian\u201d architectural modernism and a politics of the archive, through the activity of figures and organs of building practice, pedagogy, and discourse in South Asia in the twentieth century, particularly that of the architect Minnette de Silva and institutions and projects with which she associated, such as the journal MARG. Siddiqi\u2019s work has been supported by the Social Science Research Council, the Graham Foundation, the Institute of Fine Arts and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University, and the Institute of Urban and Landscape Studies at the University of Basel. She has previously held positions at Bryn Mawr College and The New School.'}

Her research explores aspects of "holographic duality," a powerful conjecture which postulates a link between some near-intractable physical systems and higher-dimensional theories which are simpler to solve. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, where she studied applications of holographic duality to components of atomic nuclei, and predicted a new phase of matter at the center of neutron stars. She pursued postdoctoral work at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where she used holographic duality to build intuitive physical models for junctions between superconductors. At NYU, Sophia is working with Professor Gregory Gabadadze and Dr. Mark Wyman to understand the holographic duality interpretation of models in which the force carrier of gravity has mass.'}

She completed her doctoral degree in Food Policy and Applied Nutrition at the Tufts University Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy. Her doctoral thesis, \u201cHealthy Eating in Vulnerable Salvadoran Communities\u201d, focused on underscoring the importance of diet quality as part of the food security experience, contrasting lay perceptions with expert knowledge. Her current work analyzes expert discourse concerning nutrition and culinary knowledge in the Spanish Caribbean, contextualized in ongoing changes in urban food systems in the region, particularly in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Havana, Cuba. She is also engaged in an ethnographic study on the importance of food and national cuisine as part of the immigrant experience in New York City.'}

Kwami is currently working on a book manuscript based on his dissertation, a recording project featuring his original compositions for quintet, and articles exploring free improvisation and experimentalism in music, and notions of race and authenticity in commercially-mediated hip-hop.'}

Trevor\u2019s primary research interest is in police-community relations, namely the degree of authority neighborhood residents, local governments, and various community groups hold over associated police departments. His scholarship addresses a variety of topics in criminal justice including racial peer-group identification among African-American police officers, social norms discouraging cooperation with police, and racial profiling. Trevor's current research investigates resistance among state and local governments to the Homeland Security model of integrated security governance, specifically in the cases of \u201cimmigrant sanctuary\u201d and marijuana decriminalization. This inquiry highlights the significance of federalist jurisprudence to the quality and scope of state and local crime governance."}
