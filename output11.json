With the present development of biotechnology industries, however, more and more scientists are entering research positions in industry, since a good deal of the research performed in this new and developing sector is in essence \"basic research.\" In addition to research and/or teaching, some scientists leave \"hands on\" work for positions with government or private funding agencies, or agencies concerned with such issues as environmental protection, scientific ethics, education policy, and the like. Finally, some become popular periodical science writers or editors for scientific publishing companies.

{"text": "In these programs, students are registered for a master's degree, and they take several medical school classes with first-year medical students. The object is ostensibly to prepare the candidate for research and similar work in the health sciences. It is no secret, however, that many students use these programs fruitfully to improve their chances of admission to medical school (sometimes also to veterinary medical or dental school). There are a number of programs which give students the opportunity to demonstrate that they can handle the course work and then reapply to medical school. Obviously, good grades in the classes show that the student can succeed in professional school. Students are permitted\u2014even encouraged\u2014to apply to medical school and are by no means required to complete the master's programs (some of the programs are for only one year). You would not be exempted from the first year of medical school because you will not have completed the entire first year. Exemption from the particular courses already completed is entirely at the discretion of the medical school of matriculation. Two words of warning: A student considering this approach should bear in mind that the probable reason for his or her original nonacceptance to medical school was grades. Is it realistic to expect a significant improvement in the upcoming year to cause a medical school to change its opinion? Every other student in the program is going to be in a similar situation, trying equally hard. Only a small percentage will actually gain admission. For this reason it would be wise to enroll only in those programs which, should you still not be admitted to medical school, provide you with some extra qualification which you can use in an alternative career, should that be necessary.NEARBY PROGRAMS: Drexel University College of Medicine Medical Science Programs245 North 15th Street, Mail Stop 344 Room 4122 NCB Philadelphia, PA 19102-1192 Tel: (215) 762-4692 http://www.drexelmed.edu/ Georgetown University \"Biomedical Graduate Education\" 3900 Reservoir Road NW, Box 571411-G NE303 Medical-Dental Building Washington, DC 20057-2197 Tel: (202) 687-3690http://biomedgrad.georgetown.edu/ Georgetown University Special Masters Program in Physiology RM 237 Basic Science Bldg Washington, DC 20057 Tel: (202) 687-7979 http://smp.georgetown.edu/University of Medicine and Dentistry of NJ Master of Science in Biomedical Scienceshttp://gsbs.umdnj.edu/New York Medical CollegeMaster of Science in Basic Medical SciencesValhalla, NY 10595Tel: (914) 594-4000http://www.nymc.edu/Albert Einstein College of MedicineMaster of Science in Clinical Research1300 Morris Park AveBronx, NY 10461Tel: (718) 430-2000http://www.einstein.yu.edu/", "current_url": "http://prehealth.cas.nyu.edu/page/careers.alliedhealth"},

{"text": "Students who are attracted to the health professions because they are particularly interested in the art of healing might want to give serious thought to nursing. Nurses provide direct care to people of all ages and in a variety of settings. Nursing care includes health promotion activities such as nutrition; immunization or baby care information; disease prevention such as blood pressure screening; acute care, including first aid and CPR; and rehabilitative care. With the changes taking place in the medical profession the opportunities open for motivated and ambitious nurses are many. Clearly there are many similarities between the work performed by nurses and M.D.s. Nursing combined with a specialty (e.g., nurse-anesthetist) or nurse-practitioner are longer-term goals where autonomy and flexibility are making this area exceptionally attractive. The employment opportunities are excellent; there is a shortage of nurses. Salaries have increased dramatically in the past several years, the types of settings in which nurses work are endless, and hours and conditions are extremely flexible. While it is possible to enter directly into a B.S.N. degree program from high school, there are well over 100 accelerated nursing programs of 12-18 months designed specifically for people who have earned B.A.s in other areas. At NYU, there is a 15-month program leading to the B.S.N. degree and R.N. certification. The NYU Division of Nursing also offers the Dual Degree B.S./M.A. Program for students interested in becoming a Nurse Practitioner. At schools without an accelerated program, you would generally apply as a transfer student, receive transfer credit for the required science and liberal arts courses, and then proceed with the nursing sequences. Nursing schools vary widely in how they treat college graduates, so you should check with the schools in which you are interested. \r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS: For college graduates: A grade point average of 3.0 or above; postbaccalaureate science courses of above 3.0.", "current_url": "http://prehealth.cas.nyu.edu/page/careers.medical"},
